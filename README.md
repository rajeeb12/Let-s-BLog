This is a Blog website. For the front end, I have used React + Vite; for the back end, I have used Node.js,  express, and MongoDB (for storage).
The starting login and registration page is also there.
I  have implemented authentication and authorization using JWT.
Users can create, upload, and read the post.
For writing a blog I have implemented an editor where users can write titles, and content summary and can upload image for the blog.
I have implemented a feature in which the user who has posted the blog can only edit the post. Other users can only view and click on the blog.
